# FLASK AUDIT LOG SERVICE

## Overview

This project is an audit log service that provides an API for accepting event data sent by other systems, storing them and querying recorded event data by field values. It has been developed with Python Flask Framework and uses Postgresql and Elasticsearch for storing data. All incoming logs get validated for their event type then theyâ€™re stored to the Elasticsearch.
